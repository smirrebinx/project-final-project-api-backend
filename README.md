This React Redux project implements a full-stack booking application with a frontend and backend connected via an API. The API features registration and login routes, along with an authenticated endpoint. The frontend includes a registration form that communicates with the API to create new user accounts. Passwords in the database are encrypted using bcrypt, and the API performs input validation, returning error messages that can be displayed on the frontend.
